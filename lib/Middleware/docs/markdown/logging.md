## Logging
### Description

The Widget API allows you to view logs from your widgets in real-time, on a Mac. You can use this by simply using these built-in JavaScript functions:

- `console.log`
- `console.info`
- `console.warn`
- `console.error`

These messages will then appear in the built-in Console application of macOS when your device is connected over USB. You can search for the name of your widget to filter out everything else.

For example, the logs for the widget `Weather | Card` can be found by searching for `"Weather | Card"` in Console, when viewing your device.
